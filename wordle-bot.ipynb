= \"\"\"\nYou are playing Wordle, a word-guessing game.\n\n### Game Rules:\n- You have 6 tries to guess a secret 5-letter English word.\n- Each guess must be a valid 5-letter English word.\n- After each guess, you will receive feedback on each letter:\n  - (✓) : The letter is in the secret word AND in the correct position.\n  - (-) : The letter is in the word but NOT in the correct position.\n  - (x) : The letter is not in the word.\n\n### Feedback Format:\nEach letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:\n1. (✓) : The letter is in the word AND in the CORRECT position.\n2. (-) : the letter is in the word but NOT in the correct position.\n3. (x) : The letter is NOT in the word.\n\n### Instructions:\nFor each turn:\n1. Use the feedback from previous guesses to eliminate impossible letters and positions.\n2. Think step-by-step using deduction and logic to choose your next guess.\n3. Output your thought process wrapped in `<think> ... </think>` tags.\n4. Output your final guess wrapped in `<guess> ... </guess>` tags.\n5.

I need to figure out the next guess based on previous feedback. But wait, the user hasn't provided any previous guesses or feedback yet. Hmm, maybe they're starting a new game. Since there's no history, I should just pick a common 5-letter word. Let me think of a word that's likely. Maybe \"CRANE\"? It's a valid word and has letters that are common in many words. Alternatively, \"BRIEF\" could work. Wait, but without any feedback, it's just a guess. I should go with a word that's common and has a good chance. Let's go with \"CRANE\".\n</think>\n\n<guess> CRANE </guess>\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCRANE → Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--- MODEL THINKING ---\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The first guess was CRANE, and the feedback was C(✓), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(✓). So, C and E are in the correct positions. R is in the word but not in position 2. A is present but not in position 3. N is not in the word.\n\nSo the secret word has C in position 1 and E in position 5. The letters R and A are in the word but in different positions. Since N is excluded, we can eliminate N. Also, the letters in positions 2 and 3 need to be determined. Let's think about possible letters. Since A is in the word but not in position 3, maybe it's in position 2 or 4. R is in the word but not in position 2, so it could be in 3,4, or 5. But position 5 is E, so R can't be there. So possible positions for R are 3 or 4. Also, A could be in position 2 or 4. Let's think of words that fit: C _ _ _ E. Possible letters for position 2: maybe A, R, or something else. Let's try a word like CARES. Wait, but A is in the word. Wait, CARES would be C A R E S. But position 5 is E, so that's correct. But then the letters would be C A R E S. But the feedback for A was (-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. In CARES, A is in position 2, which is allowed. R is in position 3, which is allowed since R is in the word but not in position 2. So that could work. Alternatively, maybe C R A E something? But R is in position 2, which is not allowed. So maybe C A R E S? But that would have A in position 2, which is okay. Alternatively, maybe C A E R E? No, that's not a word. Let's think of possible words. Maybe \"CARES\" is a possibility. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, CARES is a valid 5-letter word. Let's try that. So the next guess would be CARES. Let's see if that fits the feedback. If the secret word is CARES, then the feedback for CRANE would be C(✓), R(x) because R is in the word but not in position 2 (in CARES, R is in position 3). A is in position 2, which is not position 3, so A(-). N is not in the word, so N(x). E is in position 5, so E(✓). That matches the feedback. So CARES would be a good next guess. Alternatively, maybe another word like \"CRAZE\"? Let's check. CRAZE would be C R A Z E. But in that case, R is in position 2, which is not allowed. So that's invalid. So CARES seems better. So the next guess would be CARES.\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\n</think>\n- CRANE feedback: C(✓) and E(✓) are in correct positions. R is in the word but not in position 2. A is in the word but not in position 3. N is excluded.\n- Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: A or R. Try a word like CARES (C A R E S) to test A in position 2 and R in position 3.\n<guess> CARES </guess>\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCRANE → Feedback: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nCARES → Feedback: C(✓) A(✓) R(x) E(-) S(x)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--- MODEL THINKING ---\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The secret word is a 5-letter word. I have two previous guesses: CRANE and CARES. Let's break down the feedback.\n\nFirst, CRANE's feedback: C is correct (✓), R is incorrect (x), A is in the word but wrong position (-), N is not there (x), E is correct (✓). So the secret word has C and E in the correct positions. Wait, no—wait, the feedback for CRANE is C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓). So C is in the correct position (first letter), E is in the correct position (fifth letter)? Wait, CRANE is C-R-A-N-E. So the feedback says C is correct (so first letter is C), E is correct (so fifth letter is E). But A is in the word but wrong position, so A is present but not in the third position. R is not in the word, and N is not.\n\nThen, the second guess is CARES: C(✓) A(✓) R(x) E(-) S(x). So C is correct (first letter), A is correct (second letter?), but wait, the feedback for A is (✓), which means it's in the correct position. Wait, CARES is C-A-R-E-S. So the feedback says C(✓) (so first letter is correct), A(✓) (so second letter is correct), R(x) (not in the word), E(-) (so E is in the word but wrong position), S(x) (not in the word). Wait, but from the first guess, E was in the fifth position (from CRANE's feedback). But in CARES, E is in the fourth position, and feedback is E(-), meaning E is present but wrong position. That suggests that E is in the word but not in the fourth position. But from CRANE, E was in the fifth position. So that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the feedback.\n\nWait, the first guess was CRANE, which is C-R-A-N-E. The feedback for that was C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓). So C is correct (position 1), E is correct (position 5). So the secret word has C in first position and E in fifth. Then, the second guess is CARES: C-A-R-E-S. The feedback is C(✓) A(✓) R(x) E(-) S(x). So C is correct (position 1), A is correct (position 2?), but E is in the fourth position here, but the feedback is E(-), meaning E is present but not in the fourth position. But from the first guess, E is in the fifth position. So that's consistent. So the secret word has E in fifth position, and A in second position. Wait, but in the second guess, A is in position 2, and the feedback is A(✓), so that's correct. So the secret word has A in position 2, C in 1, E in 5. Then R is not in the word, S is not. N is not (from first guess). So letters so far: C, A, ?, ?, E. The third letter is unknown, but the second is A. So possible letters for the third position? Let's see. The letters that are confirmed: C (1), A (2), E (5). The third and fourth letters are unknown. Also, from the first guess, A was in the third position but feedback was A(-), meaning A is present but not in third position. But in the second guess, A is in the second position and feedback is A(✓), so that's correct. So the third letter is not A. So the third letter is something else. Also, from the second guess, E is in the fourth position but feedback is E(-), so E is in the word but not in position 4. But from the first guess, E is in position 5, so that's correct. So the secret word is C _ _ _ E. The second letter is A, so C A _ _ E. Now, what's the third and fourth letters? Let's think. From the first guess, CRANE's feedback: A is in the word but not in position 3. So the A is in position 2, which is correct. So third and fourth letters are not A. Also, from the second guess, R is not in the word. So letters not in the word: R, N, S. So possible letters for third and fourth positions: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But need to find letters that fit. Also, the secret word is 5 letters, so possible words. Let's think of possible words starting with C, second letter A, fifth E. So C A _ _ E. Let's think of words like \"CABLE\", \"CABIN\", \"CAVES\", \"CAMEO\", but \"CAMEO\" has O, but that's possible. Wait, but from the first guess, the feedback for A was in the word but not in position 3, so A is in position 2. So the third letter is not A. Also, from the second guess, E is in position 4 but feedback is E(-), so E is not in position 4. So the fifth is E. So possible words: C A _ _ E. Let's think of possible words. C A B E E? No, that's not a word. C A R E E? No. C A L E E? Maybe \"CALED\"? Not sure. Wait, maybe \"CABIN\" is C A B I N. But that ends with N, not E. Hmm. Alternatively, \"CAMEO\" is C A M E O. But that ends with O. Not matching. Wait, maybe \"CABIN\" is not right. Or \"CABIN\" is C A B I N. But that's 5 letters. But the fifth letter is N. But according to the feedback from CRANE, E is in position 5. So that's not possible. So the fifth letter must be E. So the word is C A _ _ E. Let me think of words that fit. Maybe \"CAVES\" is C A V E S. But that ends with S, not E. Wait, but the fifth letter is E. So maybe \"CABEE\"? Not a real word. Or \"CALED\"? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the third letter is I and fourth is D? Like \"CABID\"? Not sure. Or \"CABED\"? \"CABED\" is a word? Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the third letter is O and fourth is D? \"CAODE\"? Not a word. Alternatively, maybe the third letter is R, but R is not in the word. From the second guess, R is excluded. So third letter can't be R. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is \"CANOE\", but that's C A N O E. But from the first guess, N is excluded (feedback from CRANE: N(x)), so N is not in the word. So that's not possible. So N is out. So third letter can't be N. So maybe the third letter is something else. Let's think again. The secret word is C A _ _ E. The third and fourth letters are unknown. What letters are possible? Let's think of possible 5-letter words starting with CA and ending with E. For example, \"CABLE\" (C A B L E). That's a word. But in that case, the third letter is B, fourth is L. But is that possible? Let's check if that fits with previous feedback. From the first guess, CRANE: C R A N E. The secret word is CABLE. So in the first guess, CRANE: C is correct, R is not in the word (correct), A is in the word but not in position 3 (correct, since in CABLE, A is in position 2). N is not in the word (correct). E is correct (position 5). So that fits. Then, the second guess is CARES: C A R E S. The secret word is CABLE. So in CARES, C is correct (position 1), A is correct (position 2). R is not in the word (correct), E is in the word but in position 4 (but in CABLE, E is in position 5. So in the second guess, E is in position 4, but the secret word has E in position 5. So the feedback for E would be (-), which matches. So that's correct. So CABLE is a possible word. But is that a valid word? Yes, \"cable\" is a word. Alternatively, \"CABIN\" is C A B I N, but that ends with N, not E. So not possible. Another possibility is \"CALED\", but that's not a standard word. Wait, \"CAMEO\" is C A M E O. But ends with O. Not E. Hmm. Maybe \"CAVE\" is part of it, but that's 4 letters. Alternatively, \"CAVES\" is C A V E S. But that's 5 letters, but ends with S. Not E. So maybe the secret word is CABLE. But I need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is \"CABIN\" but that's not possible. So given the feedback, CABLE seems like a possible candidate. So the next guess would be CABLE. But wait, the user hasn't provided any more feedback, so the next guess would be to try CABLE. But I need to check if that's a valid word. Yes, \"cable\" is a valid 5-letter word. So the next guess would be CABLE. Alternatively, maybe there's another word. Let me think again. The secret word is C A _ _ E. Let's think of other possibilities. \"CABER\" is a word? Yes, a caber is a large pole. But that's C A B E R. But the fifth letter is R, not E. So no. \"CABIN\" is C A B I N. Not matching. \"CABIN\" is 5 letters, but ends with N. So no. \"CABED\" is a word? Maybe not. \"CABED\" is past tense of cab? Not sure. Alternatively, \"CALED\" is not a word. \"CALED\" is a past tense of cald, but that's not standard. So maybe CABLE is the best fit. So the next guess would be CABLE.\n</think>\n\n</think>\n</think>\n\n</think>\n- CRANE feedback: C(✓) E(✓) → C in 1st, E in 5th. A is in word but not 3rd.

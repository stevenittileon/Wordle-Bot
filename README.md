# Wordle Bot

A Python-powered bot that solves Wordle puzzles using logic, frequency analysis, and strategic guesses. This notebook demonstrates how a simple AI can effectively crack the Wordle game, often in fewer than 6 attempts.

## üìå Features

- Solves Wordle puzzles algorithmically.
- Implements letter frequency analysis to optimize guesses.
- Adapts based on feedback (`green`, `yellow`, `grey`) like the real game.
- Easy to modify and extend with new strategies.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. The bot starts with a high-frequency English word.
2. After receiving feedback (e.g., green, yellow, gray):
   - It filters out words that don‚Äôt match constraints.
3. Chooses the next optimal word based on letter frequency among remaining candidates.
4. Repeats until the word is guessed or turns are exhausted.

## üß™ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Prompt Engineering
- NLTK or custom word frequency dataset (if applicable)
- Basic NLP & pattern matching
